# One Pro IMU Retriever Demo

A demo head tracking solution for the `XREAL One Pro` glasses using IMU sensor data.

This is a proof of concept. The `imu_reader.py` retrieves a stream of data from the XREAL One Pro's IMU via TCP, parsing the gyroscope and accelerometer data. I hope this will be helpful for future open-source projects involving the XReal One/One Pro, such as those involving support for e.g. SteamVR and Android XR.

If you use any code or knowledge from this project in your own work, please acknowledge it by mentioning either me or the project.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Use the Launcher (Recommended)
```bash
python launcher.py
```

### Option 2: Direct Launch Demo

```bash
# Console mode
python console_head_tracking.py

# 3D visualization mode
python head_tracking_3d.py
```

## 📋 Requirements

### Basic Console Mode
- Python 3.7+
- XREAL One Pro glasses

### 3D Visualization Mode
Additional requirements:
```bash
pip install pygame PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate numpy
```

## 🎮 Features

### Console Mode
- **Real-time head tracking** with pitch, yaw, roll values
- **Visual orientation bars** showing head position
- **Automatic gyroscope calibration** (press R to set recalibrate bias)
- **Zero view functionality** (press T to set current orientation as forward)
- **Movement descriptions** (nodding, turning, tilting)

### 3D Visualization Mode
- **OpenGL-based 3D cube** controlled by head movement

## ⌨️ Controls

### Console Mode
- **T** - Zero view (set current orientation as forward)
- **R** - Recalibrate gyroscope
- **Q** - Quit
- **Ctrl+C** - Emergency quit

### 3D Mode
- **T** - Zero view
- **R** - Recalibrate gyroscope
- **+/=** - Increase sensitivity
- **-** - Decrease sensitivity
- **Q/ESC** - Quit

## 🔧 Configuration

### Scaling Factors (in fetchX1imu.py)
```python
# Adjust these values in HeadTracker.__init__()
self.pitch_scale = 3.0   # Up/down sensitivity
self.yaw_scale = 60.0    # Left/right sensitivity  
self.roll_scale = 1.0    # Tilt sensitivity
```

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### IMU Data Processing
1. **TCP Connection** to glasses at 169.254.2.1:52998
2. **Protocol Decoding** of binary sensor data
3. **Gyroscope Calibration** (500 samples at startup)
4. **Sensor Fusion** using complementary filter (96% gyro, 4% accelerometer)
5. **Orientation Integration** with bias correction

### Coordinate System
- **X-axis (Pitch)**: Forward/backward head tilt
- **Y-axis (Yaw)**: Left/right head rotation
- **Z-axis (Roll)**: Left/right head tilt

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- I tested it only on XReal One Pro, maybe the One is not supported.
- Check network connection to 169.254.2.1
- Verify glasses haven't ethernet turned off (developer menu).

### Calibration Problems
- Keep glasses completely stationary during calibration
- Place on flat surface for best results
- Press R to recalibrate if tracking drifts

### 3D Mode Issues
- Install all required packages: `pip install pygame PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate numpy`
- Ensure OpenGL drivers are properly installed
- On macOS, may need to grant Python screen recording permissions

### T, R or Q Key Not Working
- Try typing 't', 'r' or 'q' and pressing ENTER instead of just T, R or Q
- Check if terminal is in focus
- Use launcher for better keyboard handling

## Nice to Know

- **Update Rate**: ~1000Hz from IMU sensor
- **Display Rate**: 60Hz (3D mode), 10Hz (console mode)
- **Latency**: <10ms end-to-end
- **Calibration Time**: ~0.5 seconds
